Previously we learned how to predict continuous-valued quantities (e.g., housing prices) as a linear function of input values (e.g., the size of the house).  Sometimes we will instead wish to predict a discrete variable such as predicting whether a grid of pixel intensities represents a "0" digit or a "1" digit.  This is a classification problem.  Logistic regression is a simple classification algorithm for learning to make such decisions.
